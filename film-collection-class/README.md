# Film Database Manager

Create a `FilmDatabase` class that will have the ability to:

1. Get all films in a database
2. Get film statistics in the database (total films, average rating, highest rating, lowest rating)
3. Get the top rated films in the database
4. Search for films by the following filters: title, year, genre
5. Add a film to the database

## Bonus Challenges

1. Add validation to ensure ratings are between 0-10. This should be implemented anywhere where there is potential for ratings to be changed
2. Add a method to mark a film as watched/unwatched
3. Add a method to update a film's rating
4. Add a method to remove a film from the database
5. Add a method to get films by a given decade (1990s, 2000s, etc.)
6. Add a method detect if a given film already exists in the database (same title and year)
