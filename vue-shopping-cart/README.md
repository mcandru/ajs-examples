# Vue Shopping Cart Calculator

Build a functional shopping cart with Vue to practice reactive state management, computed properties, and event handling.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Open your browser to the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173)

## Your Task

Complete the Shopping Cart Calculator by implementing the missing Vue functionality. The scaffolding is provided, but you'll need to fill in the core Vue concepts.

### Features to Implement

- Product catalog
- Shopping cart
- Price calculations
- Clear cart

- Bonus: Try to refactor the code into separate components. Split it into components that make the most sense to you
