# Vue Testing Practice

A simple Vue application to practice writing unit and component tests.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. To see the components in action:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Run the tests:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. All tests will fail initially. Your job is to complete them!

## Exercises

Complete the test files in order:

1. **tests/utils/calculator.test.ts** - Basic unit testing with pure functions
2. **tests/components/Counter.test.ts** - Component mounting and user interactions
3. **tests/components/TodoItem.test.ts** - Testing props and events

Each test file has TODO comments guiding you on what to implement.
