# Vue RSVP

Build a functional event sign-up form with Vue to practice form building with VeeValidate and form validation with Zod.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Open your browser to the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173)

## Your Task

Complete the event sign-up form by implementing the missing Vue functionality. The scaffolding is provided, but you'll need to fill in the VeeValidate and Zod code.

### Features to Implement

- Add a schema to validate the form against
- Use `<Field>` tags where appropriate to validate the form fields and display error messages where needed
- Implement the `totalPrice` computed method to display the total price in real time

- Bonus: Try to implement the "Save Draft" button by using local storage to store the form state and load it back on a page refresh
