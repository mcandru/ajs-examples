# TypeScript Activities

This is a collection of small TypeScript exercises to help familiarise you with the language.

## Instructions

1. `cd /typescript/activities && npm install`
2. For each activity, there is an `npm run test:partx` and `npm run check:partx` to run the tests and run type checking. Make changes to the code until both succeed.

If you're using VSCode, you should have intellisense built-in which will warn you whenever there is a type error.
